Just using this to practice some Objective C as I noticed myself getting a bit rusty. (that's rusty as in not as familiar... Not writing in Rust, although that would be cooler)

This sample
* conforms to a protocol
* uses dispatch queue 
* extends a class with a category
* uses CoreGraphics to extract raw image data
* uses CoreAnimation to render a gradient view
* embeds a ViewController into a Nav Controller into a Tab bar Controller
* uses a table view controller
* demos accessing swift code from objc

(this list is not intended to impress, just to note what this might be useful for reference.)
